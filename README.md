## ⚡ The Challenge: Crowdfunding in Pure Privacy

Monero is the gold standard for financial privacy. But if you are a developer, streamer, NGO, or the author of a CCS proposal, this absolute privacy becomes your biggest bottleneck:
* **The Trust Gap:** How do you prove to your community that you've actually received 45 XMR out of a 100 XMR goal without making them wait for manual spreadsheet updates?
* **The Security Nightmare:** Sharing wallet screenshots or raw logs is unprofessional, but exposing your **private spend key** just to prove your balance is suicidal — one mistake, and all your funds are gone.
* **The Routine Drain:** Manually tracking incoming donations, verifying hashes for users, and updating progress bars on your website takes hours that should be spent writing code or creating content.

**If your community can't see the progress, momentum dies, and donations dry up.**

---

## 🚀 The Solution: XMR Fund Transparency Suite

**XMR FTS** turns voluntary transparency into a powerful tool to build trust and accelerate your funding goals. By utilizing Monero's native mathematical architecture, it scans the blockchain using **only your private view key**.

Your coins remain 100% secure in cold storage, while your donors get a beautiful, interactive, real-time proof of your fund's life and milestones.

### 🎯 Why use XMR FTS for your next campaign?

* **Eliminate "Donation Hesitation":** When donors see a beautiful, real-time cumulative chart moving toward a milestone, the "FOMO effect" kicks in. They want to be the ones who push the progress bar to 100%.
* **Zero-Maintenance Transparency:** Drop our sleek, responsive widget into your existing website or blog. Once it's there, you never have to manually report a donation again. The suite automatically detects blocks, updates progress, and keeps your community in the loop.
* **Keep Personal Funds Personal:** Built-in **Sub-Address Isolation** means you can generate a specific sub-address (starting with `8...`) for a target campaign (e.g., "Buy me a coffee"). XMR FTS will strictly track that sub-address, completely ignoring your main wallet balance and personal transactions.
* **Professional Audit-Ready Reports:** Generate executive cryptographic summaries or download structured financial sheets (PDF, XLSX, CSV, XML, JSON) with a single click to back up your milestone claims on Reddit, Gitlab, or the Monero CCS platform.
* **Engage Donors Instantly:** Use the built-in microblog to publish code updates or status reports directly inside the public widget. When people come to donate, they don't just see a cold QR code — they see active development and a live 24-hour fresh news counter.

> **Multi-Wallet, Multi-Fund Architecture:** A single XMR FTS instance can manage **multiple view-only wallets**, each containing **multiple funds** with their own deposit sub-addresses. Switch between wallets and funds in the dashboard, give each fund its own branded widget, and let the background scanner handle them all.

---

## Key Features

### 🔒 View-Key Only Security

Your private view key is **never stored in plaintext**. It is encrypted at rest using **AES-256 via Fernet** (`cryptography` library) with a master secret from the `VIEW_KEY_MASTER_SECRET` environment variable. The scanner decrypts it in-memory only during RPC calls, and the key is **never logged**.

### 💼 Multi-Wallet Support

Connect **multiple Monero view-only wallets** to a single XMR FTS instance. Each wallet is independently managed — create, pause, or remove wallets at any time. The background scanner cycles through all active wallets, and the dashboard provides a wallet selector to switch between them.

### 🎯 Sub-Address Isolation (`deposit_address`)

Each fund exposes an optional `deposit_address` field. When set (for example, a subaddress starting with `8...`), the scanner **filters all incoming transfers** and counts only transactions arriving at that specific address. Personal transfers to the primary address or other subaddresses are silently ignored.

Changing the `deposit_address` automatically resets scan history and triggers a full rescan.

### 🎨 Per-Fund Widget Styling

Each fund has its own `widget_background_color` and `widget_text_color`, configurable via the fund settings page. Drop a `<script>` tag into any website to display live donation progress, a QR code, and a collapsible news feed — all branded to match your campaign.

### 📊 Advanced Analytics (4 Charts)

| Chart | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Cumulative Received XMR** | Area chart showing total donations over time with Monero-orange gradient fill. |
| **Goal & Progress Tracker** | Interactive toggle between a horizontal progress bar with milestones and a radial gauge for visual fundraising targets. |
| **XMR Volume Distribution** | Bar chart of donation activity across time periods with adjustable range filters. |
| **Donation Size Segmentation** | Donut chart classifying donors into tiers: **Micro** (< 0.1 XMR), **Medium** (0.1–1.0 XMR), **Large** (1.0–5.0 XMR), **Whale** (> 5.0 XMR). |

### 🔍 Data Filtering & Multi-Sorting

The transaction table supports **multi-column sorting** (for example, `timestamp:desc,amount_xmr:asc`) and rich filtering by:

- **Date range** (`start_date`, `end_date`)
- **Amount tiers** (`tiers=micro,medium,large,whale`)

Filter logic lives in a single shared module (`backend/app/filters.py`) and is reused by the paginated list, exports, and public widget.

### 📄 Multi-Format Financial Reports

Download professional reports in **PDF, XLSX, CSV, XML, and JSON** from a unified endpoint:

- **PDF** — Rendered via Jinja2 → HTML → WeasyPrint with a detailed header (actual balance, target balance, filter metadata, last scanned height) and footer calculations.
- **XLSX** — Generated with `openpyxl`.
- **CSV, XML, JSON** — Standard structured formats for accounting integrations.

All exports respect the same filters and sorting as the live transaction table.

### 📢 News Micro-Blog Inside Public Widget

- Manage short fund announcements directly from the admin dashboard.
- Posts are tied to a fund via foreign key with **CASCADE** delete.
- The public embed widget includes a collapsible News section with a **freshness badge** (`+N`) when posts were published within the last 24 hours.
- The widget also renders a **QR code** pointing to the donation address.

### ⚡ Real-Time Updates via SSE

The scanner publishes events to Redis Pub/Sub. The frontend listens to `/api/v1/wallets/{id}/events` over **Server-Sent Events** (SSE) with a 30-second heartbeat, updating the dashboard instantly as new donations arrive — no polling required.

### Data Model

```text
Wallet 1 ──┬── Fund A (deposit_address: 8abc…) ──┬── Transaction 1
           │                                       └── Transaction 2
           ├── Fund B (deposit_address: 8def…) ──┬── Transaction 3
           │                                       └── Post 1
           └── Fund C (deposit_address: 8ghi…) ──── Post 2

Wallet 2 ──── Fund D (deposit_address: 8jkl…) ── Transaction 4
```

- One **Wallet** holds the view key and represents a Monero view-only wallet on `monero-wallet-rpc`.
- Each **Fund** has a unique `deposit_address` (typically a sub-address) and belongs to one wallet.
- **Transactions** and **Posts** are linked to both a fund and a wallet (with cascade delete).

## Quick Start & Deployment

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- `openssl` (available on virtually all Linux distributions)
- A Monero wallet with its **private view key** and **primary address**

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/risubrevis/xmr-fund-transparency-suite.git
cd xmr-fund-transparency-suite
```

### Step 2: Run the Setup Script

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

On the first run, the script will:

1. Auto-generate an `.env` file from `.env.example`
2. Create secure random values for `DB_PASSWORD`, `API_KEY`, and `VIEW_KEY_MASTER_SECRET`
3. Create persistent data directories (`postgres/`, `redis/`, `monero-wallet-rpc/`, `data/`)
4. Start all containers in detached production mode

After completion, the terminal will display your generated **API Key** — save it immediately, as it will not be shown again.

### Step 3: Review Critical Environment Variables

Open `.env` and verify at least these two fields before exposing the instance to the internet:

```bash
ENVIRONMENT=local     # Change to 'production' for live servers
APP_URL=localhost       # Change to your domain (e.g., dashboard.example.com)
```

### Step 4: Open the Dashboard

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and log in with your API key. From the dashboard you can:

1. **Create a wallet** — provide your Monero primary address and private view key
2. **Create funds** — each fund has its own deposit sub-address and fundraising target
3. **Customize widget** — each fund has its own colors, description, and public website

### Development Mode (Hot Reload)

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh --dev
```

Mounts the backend and worker code into the containers with `uvicorn --reload` and `watchfiles` for instant feedback.

### Other Setup Commands

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh --stop   # Stop all containers
./scripts/setup.sh --clean  # Stop and DELETE all persistent data (interactive confirmation required)
./scripts/setup.sh --init   # Prepare directories only, do not start containers
```

---

## Generating Test Data

To see charts and tables in action before real donations arrive, seed the database with demo transactions:

```bash
# Generate 150 random transactions for a test fund
./scripts/test-data.sh --count=150

# Use with the dev environment
./scripts/test-data.sh --dev --count=100

# Seed multi-wallet demo data (3 wallets × 2 funds + transactions)
./scripts/test-data.sh --multi
```

The script creates a test fund if none exists and appends new rows on every run — existing data is never deleted.

---

## Updates & Rollbacks

The `update.sh` script handles zero-downtime updates with automatic database backups.

```bash
# Update to the latest release tag
./scripts/update.sh

# Update to a specific version
./scripts/update.sh v0.2.0

# Check for available updates without applying
./scripts/update.sh --check

# List all available release versions
./scripts/update.sh --list

# Roll back to the previously deployed version
./scripts/update.sh --rollback
```

**What the script does:**

1. Creates a compressed PostgreSQL backup (`backups/*.sql.gz`, last 5 retained)
2. Fetches release tags from GitHub
3. Checks out the target version
4. Rebuilds and restarts Docker containers
5. Waits for the backend health check (Alembic migrations run automatically in `entrypoint.sh`)
6. Records the deployed version in `.deploy-version` for future rollback

---

## Production Reverse Proxy Example

Below is a minimal Nginx `server` block that proxies traffic to the frontend container. It preserves the original host, forwards real client IPs, and supports WebSocket upgrades for Vite HMR in dev mode and SSE connections.

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name dashboard.xmrfts.local;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # WebSocket support — Vite HMR + SSE
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }
}
```

> **Recommendation:** For production, terminate TLS with a valid SSL certificate (for example, via Let's Encrypt / Certbot) and redirect HTTP to HTTPS.
